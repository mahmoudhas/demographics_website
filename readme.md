Simple lightweight interactive website that asks visitors to sign their country of origin and shows a map with demographics of the visitors. Made for a local fundraiser event of an NGO. To run, just place the files in the CGI Directory.

TODO: add comments, organize code in multiple files, make code more readable..

As of March 30, 2018, the website is hosted on [mahmoudh.scripts.mit.edu](http://mahmoudh.scripts.mit.edu/).
